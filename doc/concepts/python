PRELIMINARY
CONCEPT
        python

DESCRIPTION
        Python can be used to extend the LDMud driver. At the startup
        of LDMud a python script will be called that can register
        additional efuns. The python script can either be given
        on the command line using the --python-script option,
        or at compile time with the --with-python-script configuration
        option.

        The python script can import the builtin ldmud module.
        This module provides the following functions:

          - register_efun(name, function) -> None

                Registers a new efun name. This is not allowed during
                compilation of an LPC object.

EXAMPLE
        import ldmud

        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, world!\n")

        ldmud.register_efun("hello", hello_world)

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.5 implemented the python functionality.
