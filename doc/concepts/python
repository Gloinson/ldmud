DESCRIPTION
        Python can be used to extend the LDMud driver. At the startup
        of LDMud a python script will be called that can register
        additional efuns. The python script can either be given
        on the command line using the --python-script option,
        or at compile time with the --with-python-script configuration
        option.

        The python script can import the builtin ldmud module.
        This module provides the following functions:

          - register_efun(name, function) -> None
                Registers a new efun name. This is not allowed during
                compilation of an LPC object.

          - get_master() - > Object
                Returns the current master object.
                Returns None, if there is no master object (yet).

          - get_simul_efun() - > Object
                Returns the current simul-efun object
                (or None if there is none).


        This module provides the following types:

          - Object(filename)
                Corresponds to the LPC object type.
                On instantiation a filename for an object
                to search or load is required.

          - Array([values | size])
                Corresponds to an LPC array.
                Can either be initialized with a list of values
                or to a given size.

                Supports element access with [], len() and __contains__.

          - Mapping([values | width])
                Corresponds to an LPC mapping.
                Can either be initialized with a dict, a list of tuples
                or as an empty mapping with a given width.

                Supports element access with [], len(), __contains__
                and has a width member.

          - Struct(object, name [, values])
               Corresponds to an LPC struct.
               On initialization the name of the struct definition and
               the correspopnding object is required. It can be initialized
               with a list of values or dict.

               Supports member access as regular python members.

          - Closure(object [,name [, lfun_object]])
               Corresponds to an LPC closure.
               On initialization a closure bound to <object> will be created,
               like a call to symbol_function(<name> [, <lfun_object>]).

               Supports function calls.


        This module contains the following sub-namespaces:

          - efuns
              This namespace contains all original efuns (without any
              registered python efuns or simul-efuns). These can be called
              as a regular function.


EXAMPLE
        import ldmud

        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, world!\n")

        ldmud.register_efun("hello", hello_world)

HISTORY
        LDMud 3.5 implemented the python functionality.
