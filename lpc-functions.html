<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>
  Functions are code blocks that have a name. Every LPC code that wants to
  be executed must be somewhere within a function. (There is just
  one exception: the initialization of global variables.)
</p>

<p>
  A function has a name, a return type, arguments (i.e. values given
  to the function when called) and its code block:
</p>

{% highlight c %}
    int get_square(int x)
    {
        return x*x;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  In this example the first <code>int</code> denotes the return type.
  It's followed by the function name and the arguments in parenthesis.
  After that comes the code block in braces.
</p>

<p>
  To call a function within the object just write the name
  and the values for its arguments in parenthesis,
</p>

{% highlight c %}
    x = get_square(42);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  To call a function in another object there is an <a href="lpc-efuns.html">efun</a>
  <code><a href="https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud/blob/master/doc/efun/call_other">call_other</a></code> which can be abbreviated with <code>-&gt;</code>.
</p>

{% highlight c %}
    x = ob->get_square(42);
    x = call_other(ob, "get_square", 42);
{% endhighlight %}

<h3><a name="modifiers">Modifiers</h3>

<p>
Functions and global variables can have modifiers to change the behaviour of
the function resp. variable. The modifier is written just before the return
type.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>private</code></dt>
  <dd>
    This function can only be called from within this program (this file and included
    files). Calls from other objects or inheriting programs will ignore this
    function. For global variables this means that inheriting programs
    can't access the variable.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>protected</code></dt>
  <dd>
    This function can only be called from within this object. 
    Calls via <code><a href="https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud/blob/master/doc/efun/call_other">call_other</a></code> (from this object or another object)
    will ignore this function.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>static</code></dt>
  <dd>
    This function can only be called from within this object, even
    via call_other. Calls from other objects (via <code><a href="https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud/blob/master/doc/efun/call_other">call_other</a></code>) will ignore
    this function.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>public</code></dt>
  <dd>
    The function can be called from within this object or
    from other objects. This is the default for functions.
    For global variables it prevents changing the visibility
    to private or static by inheritance. The variable will
    stay visible in inheriting programs.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>nomask</code></dt>
  <dd>
    This function cannot be overriden by inheriting objects.
    Nor can shadows shadow this function.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>deprecated</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Issue a warning whenever this function is called or the
    variable is used.
  </dd>

  <dt><code>varargs</code></dt>
  <dd>
    When calling this function from within the object
    arguments can be ommitted. Ommitted arguments will
    be set to <code>0</code>. Please note that calls
    via <code><a href="https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud/blob/master/doc/efun/call_other">call_other</a></code> are always treated as
    <code>varargs</code> calls.
  </dd>
  
  <dt><code>nosave</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Declare that this variable should not be stored
    with <code><a href="https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud/blob/master/doc/efun/save_object">save_object</a></code> or restored
    by <code><a href="https://github.com/ldmud/ldmud/blob/master/doc/efun/restore_object">restore_object</a></code>
  </dd>
